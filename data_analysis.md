# Data Analysis and Handling for Olympic Data Project

## 1. Handling Unknown or Incorrect Data

### 1.1. Date Formatting in `olympic_athlete_bio.csv`
- The "born" column in the `olympic_athlete_bio.csv` file contains birthdates in multiple formats. Our goal is to standardize all dates to the format `dd-Mon-yyyy` (e.g., 25-Feb-2025).
  - Solution: We will write a function to attempt parsing the date in various formats (`%d-%b-%y`, `%Y-%m-%d`, and `%Y`). If no valid format is found, the value will be left empty (empty string `""`).
  - Challenges: Some dates may be incomplete (only the year is provided), and we'll treat these as incomplete data and leave them empty if the exact birthdate cannot be inferred.

### 1.2. Missing Data
- Some data fields are missing in the provided datasets, such as missing birthdates, heights, or weights in the athlete bio data, or missing medal information in the event results.
  - Solution: We will leave missing values as empty strings (e.g., `""`), which is acceptable according to the instructions. If some data can be reasonably estimated (e.g., birthdate inferred from other athlete data), we will fill in those fields with the estimated values.

### 1.3. Inconsistent Data Formats
- Data inconsistencies could include incorrect units for height and weight or different date formats across the datasets.
  - Solution: For height/weight inconsistencies, we will standardize them to consistent units (e.g., height in centimeters, weight in kilograms) if needed. For date inconsistencies, we will rely on the date formatting function already in place.

## 2. Integration of Paris Data (Paris 2024 Olympics)

### 2.1. Why Paris Data Needs to Be Integrated
- The project involves adding the Paris 2024 Olympic data, which is stored separately, into the existing datasets for the complete view of Olympic history.
- The Paris 2024 athlete data needs to be merged with the main `olympic_athlete_bio.csv` dataset, and new IDs will be assigned to any athletes in Paris data who are not already present in the original data.

### 2.2. Handling Unique IDs and Avoiding Duplicates
- The Paris 2024 athlete data will be integrated into the main dataset without duplicating existing records. If an athlete participated in any prior Olympics, they are already listed in the original dataset, and we will not add them again.
  - Solution: We will check if the athlete's ID or name already exists in the main dataset before adding them. If an athlete is new, a unique ID will be assigned starting from the next available ID in the main dataset.

### 2.3. Step-by-Step Process to Integrate Paris Data
1. Load the Paris data: Read the data from the `paris/athletes.csv` file.
2. Adjust the headers: Modify the headers of the Paris data to match the column names in the existing datasets.
3. Assign unique IDs: After determining the highest existing ID in the main dataset, assign new unique IDs to Paris athletes.
4. Merge data: Combine the Paris 2024 athletes' data with the existing athlete bio data, ensuring no duplicates are added.
5. Write to new CSV file: Save the updated athlete bio data into a new file called `new_olympic_athlete_bio.csv`.

### 2.4. Data Integrity
- We ensure that the Paris 2024 data is correctly merged and that all athletes are accounted for without duplication. The unique IDs will help maintain integrity when combining the data, and the merging process will ensure no data from previous Olympics is overwritten.

## 3. How Paris Data Will Be Incorporated into Existing Data Files

### 3.1. Data Preprocessing
- The Paris 2024 Olympic data will first be cleaned by standardizing column headers, ensuring consistency with the existing datasets (e.g., the athlete bio data, event results, country data, etc.).
  
### 3.2. Merging Paris Data with Existing Datasets
- We will merge the Paris athlete data into the existing `olympic_athlete_bio.csv` file. This will be done by:
  1. Assigning new unique IDs for Paris athletes that donâ€™t already have an ID in the main dataset.
  2. Checking for duplicates by comparing the IDs or names of Paris athletes against the main dataset to avoid redundancy.
  3. Combining the Paris data with the existing athlete bio data while ensuring no data loss or corruption.

### 3.3. Updating the `olympic_athlete_bio.csv` File
- After merging, the updated dataset will be written to `new_olympic_athlete_bio.csv`, ensuring it includes all athletes, both from previous Olympics and from Paris 2024.

### 3.4. Saving the Final Results
- The final step will involve saving the new CSV files with the cleaned and integrated data, including:
  - `new_olympic_athlete_bio.csv` (with Paris data integrated)
  - `new_medal_tally.csv` (summary of medals by country and edition)
  - Other existing files, such as `olympic_athlete_event_results.csv`, `olympics_country.csv`, and `olympics_games.csv`, will be saved without any changes, except where Paris data is added in later steps.

## 4. Medal Tally Calculation

### 4.1. Tallying Medals by Country and Edition
- In the `olympic_athlete_event_results.csv` file, the goal is to calculate the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals each country has won per Olympic edition.
  - Solution: We will implement a function to iterate through the event data, tally the medals by country (NOC) and edition, and generate a summary table.
  
### 4.2. Summary File (`new_medal_tally.csv`)
- The medal tally will be saved in a new CSV file (`new_medal_tally.csv`), which will include the following columns:
  - `Edition`: The edition of the Olympic Games (e.g., Tokyo 2020, Paris 2024).
  - `NOC`: The National Olympic Committee (country code).
  - `Gold`, `Silver`, `Bronze`: The number of medals of each type won by each country in each Olympic edition.

### Conclusion:
This analysis outlines the steps for handling the provided datasets, integrating the Paris 2024 data, and ensuring the integrity of the Olympic data. The main focus is on cleaning the data, assigning unique IDs, merging datasets, and calculating the medal tally for each country. By following these steps, we ensure that the final datasets are accurate, consistent, and complete.
